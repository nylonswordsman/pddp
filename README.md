# it should probably by itself enable ansi processing for itself cuz otherwise the ansi escape codes break

!!!!!!!!
IMPORTANT: the black screen is intentional!!! thats supposed to happen!
the only reason its there at all is so that pygame accepts
input; pygame can't accept keyboard input without a display, since
it handles most events through its own window, which it needs a
display to have.
you can and probably should shove it upward a fair bit so the
terminal takes up most of the space (but not all cuz then the window
stops being focusable if you minimize it completely)

https://jsoneditoronline.org   < helps you make discs


# Todo
* music

# Making Discs
* i will write tips and such and conventions for making discs that i use
* you dont have to use them but its recommended because it makes it easier for players

* note for evidence: don't ever use no evidence or more than 9 pieces of evidence in a single debate. the code is not prepared to handle that and will crash

### When to use colors
* Gold generally indicates important things people say in discussion phases, and potential weak spots in debate phases
* A character's thoughts are indicated by grey text and being surrounded by parenthesis

## Troubleshooting

### Error Codes and What To Do

#### 01: Invalid Initialization phaseType

#### 03: The 'discs' Folder Does Not Exist

# General Notes
* this project is essentially "we have danganronpa at home"


## Credits
### Code
* below is a list of everyone who has contributed to this project's code directly. contributors can feel free to add their names or usernames here.

### Discs
* there are no disc files at present

### Music
* all of the songs in the music folder (out of the box) were stolen from the Danganronpa series' OST. below is a table of the songs as listed in the folder, their actual titles, the artists who made them, and the games they are from.
