!!!!!!!!
IMPORTANT: the black screen is intentional!!! thats supposed to happen!
the only reason its there at all is so that pygame accepts
input; pygame can't accept keyboard input without a display, since
it handles most events through its own window, which it needs a
display to have.
you can and probably should shove it upward a fair bit so the
terminal takes up most of the space (but not all cuz then the window
stops being focusable if you minimize it completely)
!!!!!!!!



## Annotations
* most if not all of the noticable waiting times are intentional
and done with the sleep function in the time module.
please dont dock points for slow-moving code its supposed to
do that its not just bad code lagging i promise :pray:
* i really wanted to use match statements because they're more
readable than super long if/elif/else chains but those were
introduced in python 3.10 so i cant use them while using pygame
since codeHS only supports pygame with python 2
* a bunch of this stuff is broken or incomplete but i promise you it
was not supposed to be. i was literally unable to work on the
project for all of the alotted time. but i was close.

## The Content
* i am not looking to be graded in any part on the story or
whatever, i just threw it together to get the thing working. it is
nothing more than a vessel through which the code is displayed, for
the purpose of this project
* this is kind of an. open-source little game thing? the idea being
that anyone can just open jsoneditoronline.org and make a disc for
other people to play

## Music 
* music does not work as CodeHS does not allow you to upload .mp3
files. it will just upload a link to the mp3 file, as a text file
with the .mp3 extension. this is exactly as confusing and a little
stupid as it sounds, though i get it.
* for this reason i cant do music in assignment version without
presumably going to absurdly convoluted lengths so i just wont
* oh well /shrug

## This Code
* i honestly really like what im making here so im probably going
to end up putting this up in a GitHub repo at some point and work
on it personally after i submit this in CodeHS
* this file (assignment.md) will be removed before flight obviously






^   school assignment. stuff for my teacher to read
v   readme. stuff for contributors and players to read.

the above section will be removed when this goes to github


# Todo
* change mentions 
* music

# Making Discs
* i will write tips and such and conventions for making discs that i use
* you dont have to use them but its recommended because it makes it easier for players

* note for evidence: don't ever use no evidence or more than 9 pieces of evidence. the code is not prepared to handle this because i am lazy

## When to use colors
* Gold generally indicates important things people say in discussion phases, and potential weak spots in debate phases
* A character's thoughts are indicated by grey text and being surrounded by parenthesis

## Troubleshooting

### Error Codes and What To Do

#### 01: Invalid Initialization phaseType

#### 03: The 'discs' Folder Does Not Exist

# General Notes
* this project is essentially "we have danganronpa at home"


## Credits
### Code
* below is a list of everyone who has contributed to this project's code directly. contributors can feel free to add their names or usernames here.
* -nylonswordsman

### Discs
* there are no disc files at present

### Music
* all of the songs in the music folder (out of the box) were stolen from the Danganronpa series' OST. below is a table of the songs as listed in the folder, their actual titles, the artists who made them, and the games they are from.
* i, nylonswordsman, own ABSOLUTELY NONE of this music.
